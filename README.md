# Micro-Processor-Assembly-Lab

This repository contains my codes for Microprocessor and Assembly Language Lab at Amirkabir University of Technology.


## Final Project

I designed an audio system with various features:

- An RGB LED which responses automatically with respect to the playing music 

- A BLE module for communicating with smartphones.

- An Android application for controlling the system (Play, pause, and change the music + controlling the LED)

## Midterm Project

I proposed a line follower robot:

- Designed and implemented a motor controller module using 8 transistors and 24 resistors.

- Used RFID sensor for authorization.

- Used 3 IR sensors to detect black lines.

- Added support for a remote controller for free driving.
